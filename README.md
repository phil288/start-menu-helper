# Description

Ever had problems with Windows 10 Start menu?  Start menu not launching, slow search, ...

I've built a solution that runs in the task bar and stays there. It searches in the start menu quickly and gives me an answer on the fly. I hope it helps someone

# Installation

I recommend that you put the executable in the startup folder.
